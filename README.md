       () Create auto-run decoders to run the script immidiately after decoding the wav file.
       
       () Support .elf file encoding/decoding
       
       () Support .macho file encoding/decoding (aka support Mac)
      
       () Support .exe file encoding/decoding
       
       () Support .apk file encoding/decoding (aka support Android)
       
       (X) Create easier interface for encoding
