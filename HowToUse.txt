script_encoder
by s1lv3r aka Loophac

How to use:

Place the file you wish to encode into the script_encoder folder.
Run the encoder.
  Ex. "python3 scriptencoder.py <infile name> <outfile name>"
    Note: the outfile name is what you want the .wav to be named

Place the .wav output file wherever you would like and place its corresponding decoder.
  Ex. If you encoded a python file, you would place the decodepython.py decoder with the .wav output file.
  
Run the decoder.
  Ex. "python3 decodepython.py <outfile name>.wav"
